        <p className='books-in-work__text'>
          Torah Rasmus is an ordinary teenager without any special talents. He lives alone with his mother, does Wushu, reads Neil Gaiman, and hates horoscopes. His life is quite predictable and boring, but it suits the guy enough. One day, on his way to the supermarket, Torah meets a mysterious girl Alice, who asks him for help. After that, he finds himself in real trouble. Very soon he realizes that he was dragged into someone else’s game, the price of which is human lives.
        </p>
        <p className='books-in-work__text'>
          Learn whether Torah will find enough inner strength and courage to get out of this game and who really «pulls the strings» as you read Eva Solska’s detective novel which got its name from its vey plot.
